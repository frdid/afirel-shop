# About Page UX Writing Guide for Amazon Affiliates

## Overview
This document explains the UX writing strategy and principles used in the Afirel Shop About page, specifically tailored for an Amazon affiliate business model.

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Transparency First
**Why it matters:** FTC guidelines require clear disclosure of affiliate relationships. Beyond legal compliance, transparency builds trust.

**Implementation:**
- Prominent Amazon Associate disclosure at the top
- Clear explanation that you earn commissions
- Honest about what you do and don't do
- No pretending to be a traditional retailer

**Example copy:**
> "I don't sell anything directly. I'm not a retailer with inventory. Instead, I carefully select products I believe offer real value, then provide you with honest insights and direct links to purchase on Amazon."

---

### 2. Personal & Authentic Voice
**Why it matters:** As a solo curator, your personality and expertise are your brand. Generic corporate speak undermines credibility.

**Implementation:**
- Use first person ("I") instead of "we"
- Share your genuine story and motivation
- Admit to being a one-person operation
- Show personality and passion for product research

**Example copy:**
> "Like many people, I used to spend hours—sometimes days—researching products on Amazon. That's when I realized: I actually enjoy this process."

---

### 3. Value Proposition Clarity
**Why it matters:** Visitors need to immediately understand what value you provide and why they should trust your recommendations.

**Implementation:**
- Lead with the problem you solve (time savings, decision fatigue)
- Emphasize your role as curator, not seller
- Highlight the research you do on their behalf
- Explain the win-win nature of affiliate relationships

**Example copy:**
> "I help you discover great products on Amazon without the overwhelming choices."

---

## Content Structure

### Hero Section
**Purpose:** Immediate introduction and value proposition

**Elements:**
- Personal identifier (name, photo/avatar)
- Clear role description (Product curator • Amazon Associate)
- One-sentence value proposition
- Friendly, approachable tone

**Word count:** 20-30 words max for main tagline

---

### Amazon Associate Disclosure
**Purpose:** Legal compliance and trust building

**Location:** Early in the page (top or just after hero)

**Required elements:**
- Statement about being an Amazon Associate
- Clear explanation of commission structure
- Reassurance that prices don't change for buyers
- Professional but not overly legalistic tone

**Pro tip:** Use a callout box or highlighted section to ensure visibility

---

### Personal Story
**Purpose:** Build connection and credibility

**Structure:**
1. Relatable problem (spending too much time researching)
2. Personal revelation (you enjoy research)
3. Solution created (the affiliate site)
4. Value delivered (helping others save time)

**Tone:** Conversational, authentic, slightly self-deprecating

**Length:** 3-4 short paragraphs (150-200 words)

---

### What I Do vs. What I Don't Do
**Purpose:** Set clear expectations and prevent confusion

**Format:** Side-by-side comparison with checkmarks (✅) and X marks (❌)

**Key inclusions:**
- **Do:** Research, curate, review, organize, earn commissions
- **Don't:** Sell directly, handle shipping/returns, accept paid reviews, control pricing

**Why this works:** Prevents customer service issues and clarifies your role immediately

---

### How It Works
**Purpose:** Demystify the affiliate model for average users

**Structure:** 3-step process
1. Your research process
2. User discovery experience
3. Purchase through Amazon (commission disclosure)

**Tone:** Simple, transparent, educational

---

### Trust Building Section
**Purpose:** Address skepticism about affiliate recommendations

**Key points to address:**
- Independence from manufacturers
- Transparency about earnings
- Personal reputation at stake
- Genuine passion for helping

**Format:** Numbered list or bullet points for scannability

**Example copy:**
> "I'd rather recommend a great $30 product than a mediocre $100 one—even if the latter pays more."

---

### FAQ Section
**Purpose:** Address common concerns preemptively

**Essential questions:**
1. Do I pay more using your links? (Answer: No)
2. Can I return products? (Answer: Yes, through Amazon)
3. How do you choose products? (Answer: Your process)
4. What if I have questions? (Answer: Reach out, but Amazon handles orders)

**Tone:** Direct, helpful, honest

---

## UX Writing Best Practices

### Voice & Tone

**Do:**
- Use conversational language ("I help you..." not "We provide solutions...")
- Write like you're explaining to a friend
- Be honest about your business model
- Show enthusiasm for your niche
- Use contractions (I'm, you'll, don't)

**Don't:**
- Use corporate jargon ("synergy," "leveraging," "solutions")
- Pretend to be bigger than you are
- Hide the affiliate relationship
- Over-promise or hype
- Write in third person if you're a solo operator

---

### Word Choice for Affiliates

**Instead of:** "We sell products"  
**Use:** "I recommend products" or "I curate collections"

**Instead of:** "Our inventory"  
**Use:** "My curated selections"

**Instead of:** "Purchase from us"  
**Use:** "Buy on Amazon through my links"

**Instead of:** "Customer service team"  
**Use:** "Amazon's customer service" or "Reach out to me for recommendations"

**Instead of:** "Our warehouse"  
**Use:** (Don't mention warehouses—you don't have one!)

---

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Copy

**For product browsing:**
- "Browse Curated Products"
- "See My Recommendations"
- "Explore Collections"
- "Find Your Next Purchase"

**For content:**
- "Read Buying Guides"
- "Check Out Reviews"
- "Learn More"

**Avoid:**
- "Shop Now" (sounds like a store)
- "Add to Cart" (you don't have a cart)
- "Buy Here" (they buy on Amazon, not your site)

---

## Legal & Compliance

### FTC Guidelines Compliance

**Required disclosure elements:**
1. Clear statement of affiliate relationship
2. Commission earnings disclosure
3. Material connection statement
4. Visible and conspicuous placement

**Sample compliant disclosure:**
> "Afirel Shop is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com."

**Best practices:**
- Place disclosure early on the page
- Use plain language, not just legal boilerplate
- Make it easily noticeable (callout box, different background)
- Don't hide it in fine print

---

## Emotional Tone Guide

### What to Convey

**Trust:** Through transparency, honesty, and disclosure  
**Expertise:** Through detailed research process description  
**Relatability:** Through shared frustration with product overwhelm  
**Helpfulness:** Through clear value proposition and time-saving benefits  
**Authenticity:** Through personal story and one-person operation admission

### What to Avoid

**Salesy pressure:** You're recommending, not selling  
**Corporate stuffiness:** You're a person, not a corporation  
**False authority:** Don't claim expertise you don't have  
**Hype:** Let the products speak for themselves  
**Defensiveness:** Own the affiliate model confidently

---

## Testing Your Copy

### Questions to Ask

1. **Is it immediately clear I'm an affiliate, not a retailer?**
2. **Would I trust this person based on this copy?**
3. **Is my commission disclosure prominent and clear?**
4. **Does my story feel authentic or manufactured?**
5. **Have I set realistic expectations about my role?**
6. **Is the value proposition clear within 10 seconds?**
7. **Would I be comfortable reading this aloud to a friend?**

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Hiding the Affiliate Relationship
**Why it's bad:** Illegal (FTC violation) and destroys trust when discovered

**Fix:** Lead with transparency. Make it a feature, not a bug.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Pretending to Be a Team
**Why it's bad:** Inauthentic. Using "we" when it's just you is misleading.

**Fix:** Own being a solo operator. It's more relatable and trustworthy.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Over-Promising
**Why it's bad:** You can't control Amazon's inventory, pricing, or shipping.

**Fix:** Set clear boundaries about what you do (recommend) vs. what Amazon does (sell/ship).

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Generic "About Us" Copy
**Why it's bad:** Sounds like every other affiliate site. No personality.

**Fix:** Tell YOUR specific story. Why you? What makes you different?

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Burying the Disclosure
**Why it's bad:** FTC violation and erodes trust.

**Fix:** Prominent placement, clear language, no tiny fonts.

---
